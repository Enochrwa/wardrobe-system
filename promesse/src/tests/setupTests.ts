// This is a setup file for Vitest.
// You can use it to configure global mocks, extend jest-dom matchers, etc.
// For now, it can be empty if no specific setup is needed for useGeolocation.test.ts

// Example: If you were using jest-dom matchers and wanted them globally available:
// import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
